## üéØ Motivation

In today's fast-paced world, accessing healthcare services can be challenging due to geographical barriers, time constraints, and the increasing burden on healthcare systems. Patients often face long waiting times and difficulty in scheduling appointments, while doctors struggle to manage their schedules efficiently. DocSync aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive, user-friendly telehealth platform.

## üìù Problem Scope & Statement

**Problem:** The lack of an integrated and accessible platform for remote medical consultations leads to inefficiencies for both patients and doctors. Patients need a simple way to find doctors, book appointments, and attend video consultations. Doctors require a system to manage their availability, conduct secure video calls, and maintain patient records.

**Scope:** DocSync is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to solve these challenges by offering:

- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for patients and doctors.
- **Doctor Discovery:** A searchable directory of doctors with detailed profiles.
- **Appointment Booking:** An intuitive system for scheduling, viewing, and managing appointments.
- **Real-time Video Calls:** High-quality, secure video consultations powered by Agora.
- **AI-Powered Symptom Analysis:** An AI assistant (powered by Google's Gemini) to help patients analyze their symptoms and find the right specialist.
- **Prescription Management:** A system for doctors to issue and patients to view digital prescriptions.
