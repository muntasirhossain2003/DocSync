# ‚úÖ Web Support Added for Video Calling!

## What Was Done

### 1. Added Agora Web SDK Scripts

Updated `web/index.html` with required scripts:

```html
<!-- Agora Web SDK -->
<script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/AgoraRTC_N-4.21.0.js"></script>
<!-- Agora Iris Web SDK -->
<script src="https://download.agora.io/sdk/release/iris_4.3.2-build.2_DCG_Web_Video_Live.js"></script>
```

## How to Run

### Quick Start

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --web-hostname localhost --web-port 8080
```

### Alternative (if Chrome doesn't open)

```bash
# Clean and run
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

## What to Expect

1. **Chrome will open automatically**
2. **You'll see permission prompts** for camera and microphone - **Click "Allow"**
3. **The app will load** with all features working
4. **Video calling will work** in the browser!

## If You Get Connection Error

The previous error was because the web scripts weren't loaded. Now they are!

**But remember:**

- ‚úÖ Browser needs camera/microphone permissions
- ‚úÖ Must allow permissions when prompted
- ‚úÖ First video call might take a moment to initialize

## Browser DevTools

If you need to debug, press **F12** in Chrome to open DevTools and check the Console tab for any errors.

## What's Different on Web vs Mobile

### Web (Browser)

- ‚úÖ Works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
- ‚úÖ No app installation needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires HTTPS for production
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly lower performance than native

### Mobile/Desktop (Native)

- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Better battery life
- ‚úÖ More stable connections
- ‚úÖ No HTTPS requirement for local testing

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. **Navigate to a consultation** with video call option
3. **Click "Join Video Call"**
4. **Allow camera/microphone** when prompted
5. **You should see your video** in the preview!

## Next Steps

### For Testing with Another User

1. Open another browser window (incognito mode)
2. Log in with a different account
3. Join the same video call
4. Both videos should appear!

### For Production

When you deploy to production, make sure:

- ‚úÖ Use HTTPS (required for camera/microphone)
- ‚úÖ Generate Agora tokens server-side
- ‚úÖ Test on multiple browsers

**Status: Ready to test! üöÄ**

Run: `flutter run -d chrome` and test the video call!
