# Payments Table Fix - Complete Guide

## Problem

The booking flow was trying to insert payment records into `public.payments` table, but only `public.subscription_payments` existed in the database.

**Error Message:**

```
Exception: Failed to record payment:
PostgrestException(message: Could not find the table 'public.payments' in the schema cache,
code: PGRST205, details: Not Found, hint: Perhaps you mean the table 'public.subscription_payments')
```

## Solution

### 1. Create New `payments` Table

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the payments table for consultation payments
CREATE TABLE public.payments (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  consultation_id uuid,
  user_id uuid NOT NULL,
  payment_type character varying NOT NULL CHECK (
    payment_type::text = ANY (
      ARRAY[
        'subscription'::character varying,
        'bkash'::character varying,
        'nagad'::character varying,
        'card'::character varying,
        'cash'::character varying
      ]::text[]
    )
  ),
  transaction_id character varying NOT NULL,
  amount numeric NOT NULL,
  status character varying NOT NULL DEFAULT 'completed' CHECK (
    status::text = ANY (
      ARRAY[
        'pending'::character varying,
        'completed'::character varying,
        'failed'::character varying,
        'refunded'::character varying
      ]::text[]
    )
  ),
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

  CONSTRAINT payments_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id),
  CONSTRAINT payments_user_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT payments_consultation_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (consultation_id) REFERENCES public.consultations(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Create indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_user_id ON public.payments(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_consultation_id ON public.payments(consultation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_status ON public.payments(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_created_at ON public.payments(created_at DESC);
```

## Table Structure Comparison

### NEW: `payments` Table (For Consultations)

| Column          | Type      | Purpose                                          |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| id              | uuid      | Primary key                                      |
| consultation_id | uuid      | Links to consultations table                     |
| user_id         | uuid      | Who made the payment                             |
| payment_type    | varchar   | 'subscription', 'bkash', 'nagad', 'card', 'cash' |
| transaction_id  | varchar   | Unique transaction ID                            |
| amount          | numeric   | Payment amount                                   |
| status          | varchar   | 'pending', 'completed', 'failed', 'refunded'     |
| created_at      | timestamp | When payment was created                         |
| updated_at      | timestamp | When payment was last updated                    |

### EXISTING: `subscription_payments` Table (Keep This!)

| Column          | Type      | Purpose                                       |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| id              | uuid      | Primary key                                   |
| user_id         | uuid      | Who purchased subscription                    |
| subscription_id | uuid      | Links to subscriptions table                  |
| amount          | numeric   | Subscription cost                             |
| payment_method  | varchar   | 'bKash', 'Nagad', 'credit_card', 'debit_card' |
| payment_status  | varchar   | 'pending', 'completed', 'failed'              |
| payment_number  | numeric   | Payment number                                |
| created_at      | timestamp | When payment was created                      |

**Key Difference:**

- `payments` = For individual consultation payments
- `subscription_payments` = For subscription plan purchases

## Code Verification

The Flutter code in `payment_service.dart` is already correct and matches the new schema:

```dart
// Record payment in database
Future<void> recordPayment({
  required String consultationId,
  required String userId,
  required PaymentType paymentType,
  required String transactionId,
  required double amount,
}) async {
  try {
    await _supabase.from('payments').insert({
      'consultation_id': consultationId,
      'user_id': userId,
      'payment_type': paymentType.name,  // âœ… Correct field name
      'transaction_id': transactionId,
      'amount': amount,
      'status': 'completed',
      'created_at': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    });
  } catch (e) {
    throw Exception('Failed to record payment: $e');
  }
}
```

âœ… **No code changes needed!** The Flutter code already expects the correct schema.

## Testing Steps

After running the SQL migration:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** â†’ SQL Editor
2. **Paste and run** the CREATE TABLE command above
3. **Verify table creation:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_name = 'payments';
   ```
4. **Test in your app:**
   - Book a consultation
   - Select any payment method
   - Click "Confirm Payment"
   - Should succeed and redirect to home

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. âœ… User books consultation
2. âœ… Selects payment method (bKash, Nagad, Card, or Subscription)
3. âœ… Clicks "Confirm Payment"
4. âœ… Payment record is saved to `payments` table
5. âœ… Consultation status updated
6. âœ… Success dialog appears
7. âœ… User redirected to home page

---

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get the error:

1. **Check RLS (Row Level Security):**

   ```sql
   -- Disable RLS for testing (enable it later with proper policies)
   ALTER TABLE public.payments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Check table exists:**

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'payments';
   ```

3. **Grant permissions:**
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL ON public.payments TO authenticated;
   GRANT ALL ON public.payments TO service_role;
   ```

---

## Enable RLS (Recommended for Production)

After testing, enable Row Level Security:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users can view their own payments
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own payments"
  ON public.payments
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = (SELECT auth_id FROM users WHERE id = user_id));

-- Policy: Users can create payments
CREATE POLICY "Users can create payments"
  ON public.payments
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = (SELECT auth_id FROM users WHERE id = user_id));

-- Policy: Service role has full access
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access"
  ON public.payments
  FOR ALL
  TO service_role
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

---

## Summary

- âœ… Created new `payments` table for consultation payments
- âœ… Kept existing `subscription_payments` table for subscription purchases
- âœ… No Flutter code changes needed
- âœ… Run the SQL migration in Supabase
- âœ… Test the booking flow

The issue is purely on the database side. Once you create the `payments` table, everything will work! ðŸš€
