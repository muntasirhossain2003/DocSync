# Video Call Audio/Video Fix

## Problem

Sometimes during video calls, audio is working (you can hear the doctor) but video isn't showing, displaying "waiting for doctors" message instead.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Remote UID Detection Issue**: The `onUserJoined` callback wasn't always firing or detecting remote users properly
2. **Video Track Subscription**: Remote video tracks weren't being properly subscribed to
3. **UI State Management**: The UI wasn't updating when remote audio/video states changed
4. **Video Canvas Configuration**: Video rendering wasn't properly configured with fallback options

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Remote User Detection (`video_call_provider.dart`)

**Added multiple callbacks to detect remote users:**

```dart
// Original: Only onUserJoined
onUserJoined: (connection, remoteUid, elapsed) { ... }

// Enhanced: Multiple detection methods
onUserJoined: (connection, remoteUid, elapsed) { ... }
onRemoteVideoStateChanged: (connection, remoteUid, state, reason, elapsed) { ... }
onRemoteAudioStateChanged: (connection, remoteUid, state, reason, elapsed) { ... }
```

**Benefits:**

- Detects remote users even if `onUserJoined` doesn't fire
- Captures remote UID when video/audio tracks start
- Better handling of network conditions

### 2. Improved Video Rendering Logic (`video_call_page.dart`)

**Enhanced remote video display:**

```dart
// Before: Simple null check
if (controller.remoteUid == null) {
  return waitingWidget;
}

// After: Smart connection detection
final bool hasRemoteConnection = controller.remoteUid != null ||
    (state == CallState.connected && controller.engine != null);
```

**Added fallback overlay:**

```dart
// Shows "Audio connected â€¢ Video loading..." when audio works but video is pending
if (controller.remoteUid == null)
  Container(
    color: Colors.black54,
    child: "Audio connected â€¢ Video loading..." message
  )
```

**Benefits:**

- Shows video view even when remoteUid detection is delayed
- Provides clear feedback when audio is connected but video is loading
- Better user experience during connection establishment

### 3. Enhanced Agora Service Configuration (`agora_service.dart`)

**Improved channel joining:**

```dart
// Added explicit audio/video enabling
await _engine!.enableAudio();
await _engine!.enableVideo();
await _engine!.startPreview();

// Enhanced channel options
options: const ChannelMediaOptions(
  autoSubscribeAudio: true,
  autoSubscribeVideo: true,
  publishCameraTrack: true,
  publishMicrophoneTrack: true,
)
```

**Benefits:**

- Ensures audio/video are enabled before joining
- Starts local preview for better video initialization
- Explicit subscription to remote tracks

### 4. UI State Management

**Added refresh mechanism:**

```dart
void refreshState() {
  state = state; // Triggers notifyListeners
}
```

**Applied to callbacks:**

```dart
onRemoteVideoStateChanged: (...) {
  // ... existing logic
  refreshState(); // Force UI update
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Forces UI rebuild when remote states change
- Ensures video appears as soon as tracks are available
- Better responsiveness to connection changes

## Testing Scenarios

The fix addresses these scenarios:

1. **Audio First, Video Later**: Shows "Audio connected â€¢ Video loading..." message
2. **Delayed Remote Detection**: Uses multiple callbacks to detect remote users
3. **Network Fluctuations**: Better handling of connection state changes
4. **Video Track Issues**: Enhanced video canvas configuration with fallbacks

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Connection Established**: User sees "Connected" status
2. **Audio Available**: If audio works first, shows audio status message
3. **Video Available**: Smoothly transitions to video view when ready
4. **Better Feedback**: Clear status messages throughout connection process

## Debug Information

Enhanced logging includes:

- Remote video state changes
- Remote audio state changes
- UID detection from multiple sources
- Connection state transitions

Look for these logs:

```
ðŸ“¹ Remote video state changed: UID=123, State=RemoteVideoStateStarting
ðŸ”Š Remote audio state changed: UID=123, State=RemoteAudioStateDecoding
ðŸ”„ Setting remote UID from video/audio state: 123
```

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to existing API
- Backward compatible with current implementation
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Better network condition tolerance
